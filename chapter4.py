	Write a function that tracks rainfall in a number of cities. Users will enter the name of a city,

	program should also ask the user how much rain has fallen in that city. After the user enters the quantity of rain,
	the program again asks them for a city name, rainfall amount, and so on--until the user presses Enter instead of
	typing the name of a city. When the user enters a blank city name, the program exits--but first, it reports how much
	total rainfall there was in each city.
